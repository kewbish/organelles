These officers are trained to scrutinize exactly what comes in: only the essentials are allowed, including water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.<br>Initially, our borders were only one line, but further research apparently showed that membranes were hydrophilic and phobic zones sandwiched between proteins. Currently, we have a model of proteins, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, dispersed throughout the border. In between the proteins, phospholipids make up the rest of the border protection forces. These phospholipids are in two lines, orienting their hydrophilic heads to water and their hydrophobic parts towards each other.<br>Contrary to popular belief, our border services are flexible and fluid. Cholesterol (another type of lipid) controls the exact amount of fluidity. At medium temperatures, they reduce movement, but hinder membrane solidification at lower temperatures by disrupting the phospholipids's connections.";

It surrounds all the other organelles, and whatever is outside of an organelle is called cytosol (a watery substance that makes up most of the cytoplasm).<br>Though it seems unorganized, cytoplasm's proteins (called the cytoskeleton) actually provide a very structured existence for Eukaria.

Microtubules help support the cell when organelles are moving, and also play a role in separating chromosomes during cell division. Centrioles help organize fibers during cell division. When a cell is divided, centrioles are 'reelected' and replicated into the new cell.<br>Centrioles are rotated at ninety-degrees to each other, and there are only two in a cell. {My diagram is technically incorrect as centrioles should have 9 spokes with three microtubules, while my diagram shows 8. They are also not shown at ninety-degrees due to the limitations of 2D space.}<br>Centrioles aren't essential to a city; plant cells don't have centrioles, and many eukaryotes don't require this function either. However, they help in the process of mitosis, and therefore make Eukaria superior, as an owner of our two dear centrioles.";

This inner membrane, called the cristae, houses the mitochrondial matrix. The matrix contains enzymes, DNA, and ribosomes, which work through cellular respiration.
